THE WOW ADDON
-------------

In-Game Commands:
  /wst           - Show addon help
  /wst update    - Update character data
  /wst status    - Show current character's tracked data

The addon automatically tracks:
  - Item level and gear tier counts
  - Vault-eligible delve completions
  - Gilded Stash claims
  - Weekly quest progress
  - Timewalking dungeon completions

Important: After running /wst update, you must /reload or log out
to save the data to disk so the desktop app can read it.


WEEKLY RESET
------------
WoW resets weekly on Tuesday at 15:00 UTC (7:00 AM Pacific).

The app automatically detects when a new week starts and clears
weekly progress data (delves, quests, vault status, etc.).
You'll see a notification when this happens.


KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
------------------
The app follows standard GTK conventions:
  Ctrl+Q  - Quit (on some systems)


DATA STORAGE
------------
Your data is stored in:
  macOS:   ~/Library/Application Support/wowstat/
  Linux:   ~/.config/wowstat/
  Windows: %APPDATA%\wowstat\

Files:
  wowstat_data.json   - Your character data
  wowstat_config.json - App settings

TROUBLESHOOTING

Characters not updating

Wrong item counts
